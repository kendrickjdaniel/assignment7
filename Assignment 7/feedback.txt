Use media queries at a 768px breakpoint
 - Good!
As a user changes the size of a browser window:

Content remains in appropriate divs
 - Good!
Content remains visible to the user
 - Your menus have some visibility problems at smaller sizes. Switching to a hamburger menu for mobile displays can help
 - Hiding the #sidebar element prevents a crampled layout in the blog, but you also could have switched to a vertical layout instead of hiding it entirely.
 - Your "#benfits ul" styling stays at hard coded pixel width, which causes some display problems on smaller screens. Changing this to a percent based width could solve this.
Fonts change size appropriately
 - Changing the size of headers and logo text can save space and look nicer on smaller displays. The hero text on the langing page would have been a good candidate for this.
Margins and padding change size appropriately
 - Good!
Content does not overlap
 - Good!
In the blog section, the two-column layout changes to a single-column layout when appropriate
 - Good!

Additional Comments:
 - Nice job fixing padding/margins and updating most of the site to percentage based widths.

 - The hard coded pixel width benefits section is causing some display problems. Text there could be made smaller and some of it could probably be removed entirely.

 - Don't forget to reduce the size of header text for mobile display. As is the blog headlines span several lines and take up most of the screen on mobile displays.
